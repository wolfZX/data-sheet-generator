# Data sheet generator

This is a personal project of mine to pratice my UI/UX and front-end development.
This app is to also help generate a mocked data sheet for your software or app testing that requires you to create and import a long list of data sheet.
You may check out the demo [over here](https://data-sheet-generator.vercel.app/).
